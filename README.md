# Microservice Architecture Structure

The server follows a **microservice architecture** where each folder inside the `server` directory represents an independent service that can operate without dependencies on other services.

## Service Structure

Each service follows a standardized 5-layer architecture:

### üõ£Ô∏è Routes

**Purpose**: API endpoint definitions using FastAPI

- Defines HTTP route handlers (`@router.get`, `@router.post`, etc.)
- Handles dependency injection
- Specifies request/response models for payload validation
- Contains minimal logic - delegates to service layer

### üè¢ Services

**Purpose**: Business logic implementation

- Contains core business rules and workflows
- Orchestrates repository operations for CRUD functionality
- Handles cross-cutting concerns (authentication, authorization, caching)
- Coordinates between multiple repositories when needed

### üìã Schemas

**Purpose**: Data validation and serialization contracts

- Defines structure and validation rules using Pydantic
- Used for data crossing boundaries (API requests/responses, database models, external APIs)
- Provides runtime type checking and validation
- Handles serialization/deserialization (JSON ‚Üî Python objects)

### üè∑Ô∏è Types

**Purpose**: Static type definitions for development

- Provides compile-time type hints for IDEs and type checkers
- Includes protocols, type aliases, generics, and unions
- **No runtime validation** - purely for development-time type safety
- Improves code organization and developer experience

### üóÑÔ∏è Repositories

**Purpose**: Data access abstraction layer

- Implements database operations using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Provides CRUD operations and custom queries
- Uses **Repository Pattern** with:
  - **Interface/Protocol**: Defines contract (what methods must exist)
  - **Implementation**: Actual database interaction logic
- Abstracts database concerns from business logic

## üìê Rule of Thumb

| **Use Schemas When**    | **Use Types When**          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Data crosses boundaries | Internal code structure     |
| Need runtime validation | Development-time hints only |
| API requests/responses  | Function signatures         |
| Database models         | Protocols and interfaces    |
| External integrations   | Type aliases and generics   |

**Key principle**: Schemas for **validation**, Types for **organization**.
